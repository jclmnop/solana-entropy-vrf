# Solana Entropy VRF
A simple alternative to Chainlink VRF designed to function on Solana by utilising
Pyth price feeds. Operated by a simple crank mechanism. 

Fully functional but still a WIP, this repo won't be updated and is only intended for
reference. 

The source code for later versions will be published and verified via Anchor after
deployment to mainnet, and the necessary cargo crate for interacting with the 
on-chain program will be published also.
